    "The Pearson Similarity metric is used to measure the rating vectors of two users (computing row-wise on the user-item matrix). We will denote the users as user *1* and user *2*. Additionally, $I_1$ and $I_2$ will denote the set of items user *1* and user *2* has rated respectfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to computing the Pearson Similarity is computing the mean rating for each user. The mean rating of user *1* is computed with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu_1 = \\frac{\\sum_i r_{1,i}}{|I_1|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where *i* is the index of the item therefore $r_{1,i}$ is the rating user *1* gave on item *i*\n",

    "The pearson similarity can then be computed between the two users:\n",

Afterwards you would just recommend the top items based off the rated scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, lets say user *1* was our target user and user *2* and *3* were the most similar users. User *1* has not rated items *4* and *5*, but user *2* and *3* have. We would predict the rating user *1* would give to items *4* and *5* with the following functions:\n",

    "\n",
    "The problem with the above metric is that it does not take into account that users may rate things differently. For example, user *1* might be very lenient with their ratings and rate things highly whereas user *2* is a tough critique and rarely gives out high reviews. The ratings need to be mean-centered before predicting ratings (the pearson similarity remains the same). To compute the mean-centered rating (we will denote this as $s_{1,i}$)for user *1* on item *i* you would simply substract the rating given to item *i* by user *1* with the average rating of user *1*.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_{1,i} = r_{1,i} - \\mu_1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the predicted value of the rating the target user would give an item, you would just substitute the raw rating $r$ with $s$. Additionally you also add the mean rating of the target user to get the final predicted value. Using the same example as above, we would predict the rating user *1* would give to items *4* and *5* with the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_{1,4} = \\frac{s_{2,4}*pearson(1,2) + s_{3,4}*pearson(1,3)}{pearson(1,2) + pearson(1,3)} + \\mu_1$$\n",

    "$$r_{1,5} = \\frac{s_{2,5}*pearson(1,2) + s_{3,5}*pearson(1,3)}{pearson(1,2) + pearson(1,3)} + \\mu_1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $r_{1,4} > r_{1,5}$, then item *4* would get recommended to user *1*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Significance Weighting\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to take into consideration is that the similarity function is affected by the number of common ratings users *1* and *2* have. If there is a small number of common ratings, the similarity function should be reduced by a discount factor to de-emphasize the importance of that user pair. You would apply this discount factor when the number of common ratings is below a certain threshold: $\\beta$. The discount factor is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{min{|I_1 \\bigcap I_2|, \\beta}}{\\beta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the Pearson Similarity score would turn to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Pearson(1,2) = \\frac{\\sum_i ((r_{1,i}-\\mu_1)(r_{2,i} - \\mu_2))}{\\sqrt{\\sum_i ((r_{1,i}-\\mu_1)^2}\\sqrt{\\sum_i ((r_{2,i}-\\mu_2)^2}}*\\frac{min{|I_1 \\bigcap I_2|, \\beta}}{\\beta} $$"

We want to make predictions on those items to see if they would be good recommendations for user *3*. Therefore, items 1 and 6 will be our target items. We will compute the Adjusted Cosine between the target item and every item to see which items are most similar to the target. For item *1* the most similar items are item *2* and *3*. For item *6* the most similar items are item *4* and *5*. We will use the Adjusted Cosine score between the target and the similar item aswell as the raw rating user *3* gave to the similar item.

    "## Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of Item-Based Collaborative Filtering is that it often provides more relevant recommendations because it using your OWN ratings to make recommendations. For example a recommonder system might look at amovie you've enjoyed and rated highly and recommend similar movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Item-Based ratings are also more stable to changes in ratings. This is because for User-Based ratings, there are a lot more users than items. This means that there will be cases where two users have a small number of the same items, but two items are much more likely to have a larger number of users who have rated both of them. This means that for User-Based ratings, just adding a few ratings can change the similarity score a lot, whereas for Item-Based it is much more stable to additions of new ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantage of Item-Based Collaborative Filtering is that they may not provide more diverse recommendations as oppose to User-Based Collaborative Filtering. Recommending more diverse items may lead to pleasant surprises or new found interests. Without enough diversity, it is possible that a user can get border with similar recommendations to items they've been recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional disadvantage is the problem of sparsity. For example if none of the nearest neighbors for one user has rated a particular item, it is not possible to predict a rating for that item. Though another to consider is that if none of the similar users have rated that item, it is possible that the target user won't like it."
